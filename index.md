# Welcome to Nightvale

## Summary

Welcome to Nightvale is best described as Lovecraftian humor, often referencing nihilism and cosmic fear. [“A friendly desert community where the sun is hot, the moon is beautiful, and mysterious lights pass overhead while we all pretend to sleep.”][1] -episode 1, 0:00.


## Organization

Welcome to Nightvale is organized like a community radio program, with segments detailing events that have happened in the town, and notable personages doing things.
>[“A commercial airliner flying through local airspace disappeared today, only to reappear in the Night Vale Elementary gymnasium during basketball practice, disrupting practice quite badly. The jet roared through the small gym for only a fraction of a second. And before it could strike any players or structure, it vanished again. This time, apparently, for good.”][1] -ep 1, 3:58
>
>[“That new scientist – we now know is named Carlos – called a town meeting. He has a square jaw, and teeth like a military cemetery. His hair is perfect, and we all hate, and despair, and love that perfect hair in equal measure.”][1] -ep 1, 5:02


## Style

The show uses custom mixed music by Disperition (link) to add mood to the narrator’s words. There are long pauses between segments where the background music can play without the narrator’s voice over it.
[The weather segment, instead of talking about the weather, is actually a guest musician playing a song, but is treated like a real weather segment, otherwise.][1] -ep 1, 12:17 [The musician is credited at the end.][1] -ep 1, 20:18

## Narrative Conventions

Sometimes, for emphasis, the music will stop and the narrator with repeat a point with menacing emphasis. 
>[“No one does a slice like Big Rico. **No one**.”][1] -ep 1, 2:37

The narrator rarely does interviews, but when he does, they come across as concerned citizens phoning into a radio station to air concerns about some specific thing that has happened, or to weigh in on a topic with an opinion. Most often, these interviews are simply narrated by the narrator instead of being played as they happen.
>[“Carlos and his team of scientists warn that one of the houses in the new development of Desert Creek, out back of the elementary school, doesn’t actually exist.
“It seems like it exists,” explained Carlos and his perfect hair. “Like it’s just right there when you look at it. And it’s between two other identical houses, so it would make more sense for it to be there than not.” ”][1](ep 1, 8:29)

There are ‘advertisements’ sometimes for real products, but with fictitious tag lines. 
>[“The local chapter of the NRA is selling bumper stickers as part of their fundraising week. They sent the station one to get some publicity. And we’re here to serve the community, so I’m happy to let you all know about it. The stickers are made from good, sturdy vinyl, and they read:<br/>
**Guns don’t kill people.**<br/>
**It’s impossible to be killed by a gun.**<br/>
**We are all invincible to bullets and it’s a miracle.**”][1]-ep 1, 7:50
